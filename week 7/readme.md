# Week 7 
This week assignment is to parse all the data entries we may need in the further projects and make the data 'clean' and ready to be used. 

Thus, my final results are all in json files and consist of 3 diffrent json files that could potentially be installed as each individual tables. 
## Process

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Script pieces

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
